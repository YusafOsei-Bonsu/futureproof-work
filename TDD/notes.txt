Unit test: Testing a line of code. Much faster because the focus is on individual lines of code. More isolated. 

Service test: Testing a code block that represents functionality (e.g. button). This kind of test is of medium-speed. 

UI test: User interaction tests (e.g. clicking, pokey-pokey, "wow that looks awful"). Some automated tests, but human tests as well.  This kind of test is slow.
