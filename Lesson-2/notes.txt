Position Property
=================
Static: Every elements fills the space it requires. However, if there's a left/right/top/bottom/z-index set then
there'll be no effect on that element.

Relative: An element's original position remains in the flow of the document, fills the space it needs. However,
we can adjust the position on the page using the top, bottom, left and right properties.

Absolute: The element is removed from the flow of the document and other elements will behave as if it's not
even there whilst all the other positional properties will work on it. 

Grid Layout
===========
If you're going to use Flex box, the parent container needs to be of the flex model too.
