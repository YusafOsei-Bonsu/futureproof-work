What is Data Science?
=====================
Data Science is the study of data that involves recording, storing and analyzing data to extract useful information.
    - Goal: Gain insights & knowledge from any data type (structured or unstructured)

We can use data science to describe past-event data to predict future. 

Process
=======
1) Source
    - Where?
    - Correct/Relevant?

2) Clean: Good to do regardless

3) Model: Digital representation of the data/situation (created using existing data)

4) Evaluate: Evaluate accuracy of produced model.

5) Repeat: Process is repeated to refine the model

6) Deploy: Use it in an application, as a lib/module/package or as a product (depending on use case)

Models

Machine Learning (ML)
=====================
ML is the study of algorithms/stats models that computer systems to perform a specific task without instruction (relies on inferences and patterns).

Supervised Learning: We give our program a dataset that's labelled with a predictable output (e.g. we're trying to determine if a visitor to our website is a bot or human)e.g.

Unsupervised Learning: We give our program a dataset, we don't know what we're looking for but we'd like our algorithm to create categories of pieces of data.

Reinforcement Learning: We provide our program with an environment to work within and a goal to maximise/minimise.
