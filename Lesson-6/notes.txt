Building blocks
===============
programming principles: Data, Action, Logic

Data: Raw facts and figures.

Information: Data with context/meaning.

Session: Temporary storage of data in your browser/server. Sessions can last from minutes to months.

Action: A process to do something.

Logic: Using data/Information to make a decision.

Algorithm: A set of unambiguous steps to solve a problem. In terms of programming, algorithms take the form of software/programs.
A good algorithm is simple, clean and efficient. Good algorithms also conclude to correct/expected outcome.

Defensive programming: Checks upfront for data types, etc. 

TDD, BDD.
